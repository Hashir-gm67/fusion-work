    description: `The Multi-Disease Prediction System is a project developed by FusionFlare Technologies aimed at creating a comprehensive application for predicting various diseases using machine learning (ML). The system integrates models trained on diseases like Diabetes, Heart Disease, Breast Cancer, and Lung Cancer into a single user-friendly interface.

    Project Phases:
    - Data Collection and Preprocessing: Collect datasets from platforms like Kaggle. Preprocess data by handling missing values and normalizing features.
    - Model Training: Train ML models for each disease using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM. Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, and F1-score.
    - Model Integration: Combine all models into a single Python application with a Streamlit-based interface for users to select and predict different diseases.
    - LLM Integration: Incorporate a Language Learning Model (e.g., GPT) to handle general disease-related queries within the app.
    - Deployment: Deploy the system on Streamlit, refining the UI/UX for an optimal user experience.`,
